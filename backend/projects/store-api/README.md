Imagine we're in charge of Store API and we want to provide a bunch of search options for our users (search by name, filtering based on price amount, etc.).

Once we're done building our API the front-end only needs to make http calls and we send back the data. So the user can search for products and the backend does all the heavy lifting. and the frontend is only responsible for http calls.
