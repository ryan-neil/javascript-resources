### What we'll learn:
  1. Learn how to set up and connect to the cloud database. In other words, learn how to persist our data to the cloud. We'll also learn how to perform all the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.

  2. We'll also be responsible for setting up the API that communicates with the cloud database and persist the data to the cloud.

> Persistent storage is any data storage device that retains data after power to that device is shut off. It is also sometimes referred to as nonvolatile storage.
