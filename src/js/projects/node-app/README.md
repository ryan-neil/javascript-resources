### Part 1: What is Node.js?

Node.js itself is not a programming language but a runtime that allows us to run JavaScript on a server and not just in the browser.

### How do we use Node.js?

1. [REPL](https://codeforgeek.com/nodejs-repl/)

The REPL acronym stands for READ, EVALUATE, PRINT & LOOP. REPL is an easy-to-use command-line tool, used for processing Node.js expressions. 

It captures the user's JavaScript code inputs, interprets, and evaluates the result of this code. It displays the result to the screen, and repeats the process till the user quits the shell.

> Note: Ctrl + C twice will shut down the REPL environment.

REPL is useful when you want to debug your code, run or test some code outside your project but in most cases we will want to execute JavaScript code that lives inside an actual JavaScript file.

2. index.js File

The default entry point into a Node.js app is the "index.js" file. We can run the code inside "index.js" with the command `node index.js` or `node <path to file>`.

Since this is an "index" file we can shorten the command by just pointing to the parent directory with, `node .`. And there we go, we just built a Node app!

### Understanding the Node runtime

In most ways, JavaScript works the same wait it does in the browser as it does in Node.js. Although, there are some very important differences we need to know about...

1. Node has a handful of built in "global" identifiers

One of those "globals" is `console`, which we are already familiar with for logging out values to the terminal. 

There's another "global" with the name of `global`. This object is a namespace that is available throughout the entire Node process. For example, if we assign a `luckyNumber` property to `global` we can then access it anywhere in our code:
```js
console.log(global.luckyNumber)

global.luckyNumber = '23';

console.log(global.luckyNumber) // -> 23
```

Frontend developers can compare `global` to the `window` object in the browser.

Now, one of the most important "globals" for us to know is `process` which gives us access to the currently running Node "process". 

We might use this to check the current platform or operating system:
```js
console.log(process.platform); // -> darwin
```

Or grab an environment variables from our server:
```js
console.log(process.env.USER); // -> ryanneil
```

### How events work in Node.js

We will often hear people describe it as an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime. The runtime implements something called an event loop similar to how a web browser does.

What this does is allow Node to push intensive operations off to a separate thread so that only very fast non-blocking operations happen on the main thread. This is also why people often refer to Node as "non-blocking".

This is a design choice that makes Node.js very suitable for things that require high throughput like, real-time applications, web servers, etc. So how does this effect us as programmers?

Typically, we won't have to think about the low-level details, we just need to understand how events and callbacks work.

#### Events

In most cases, we will listen to events. Events can come in many forms but one example is on the `process` "global" that we had a look at earlier.

Before a node process finishes it emits an event named `'exit'` and we can "listen" to this event using `on()` and register a callback function as the second argument.
```js
process.on('exit', function() {
  // logic
});
```

This is similar to our DOM event listeners:
```js
variable.addEventListener('click', function() {
  // logic
})
```

When the `exit` event occurs Node will run this function. This is where it gets it's name "callback" because the function isn't called the first time Node sees it. It's only called after the `exit` event occurs at some point in the future.

The event above is built into Node but we can also build our own from scratch. First thing we need to do is import an `EventEmitter` from the events module that is built into Node:
```js
// import the EventEmitter event
const { EventEmitter } = require('events');
```

We can then create a custom event emitter by instantiating the class and then registering a callback that fires on the `lunch` event:
```js
const { EventEmitter } = require('events');
// instantiating the class
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// register callback that fires on 'lunch' event
eventEmitter.on('lunch', () => {
  console.log('Yummy');
});
```

Now that our callback is registered, we can simply call our event emitter `emit` with the event name:
```js
const { EventEmitter } = require('events');
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

eventEmitter.on('lunch', () => {
  console.log('Yummy');
});

// call our event emitter with our event name
eventEmitter.emit('lunch'); // -> Yummy
```

This event driven style of programming is extremely useful when we have something that is CPU intensive.

### Node.js file system

Node.js have a built in file system module called `fs`. The file system module can read, write, and delete files on the file system among other things. It can also do things in a "blocking" or "non-blocking" way.

Let's look at an example of this. Let's create a `.txt` file inside our app directory. We'll add some text inside, "Oh, hello file system!". 

Back in our index.js file we'll import two functions from the file system module:
```js
// import two functions from the file system module
const { readFile, readFileSync } = require('fs');
```

> Note: Anytime we see a function that ends in "sync", think "blocking" or in other words, it will need to finish all of it's work before any of our other code can run.

We can read a `txt` file with Node by simply passing the path to that file and then specifying the encoding as `utf8`. This is a "blocking" method:
```js
const { readFile, readFileSync } = require('fs');

// read our txt file
const txt = readFileSync('./hello.txt', 'utf8');

console.log(txt); // this runs first
console.log('do this asap'); // this runs second

// -> Oh, hello file system!
// -> do this asap
```

Reading a file could take a while especially if it's a very large file. What you'll notice when we run our code is the second `console.log` won't run until after the `hello.txt` file has been read.

If we want to transform the example above to "non-blocking" we can refactor the code to a callback. with `readFile` we can pass the same first two arguments and then add a callback function as the third argument:
```js
const { readFile, readFileSync } = require('fs');

// read our txt file
readFile('./hello.txt', 'utf8', (err, txt) => {
	console.log(txt); // -> this runs second
});

console.log('do this asap'); // -> this runs first
// -> do this asap
// -> Oh, hello file system
```

Inside the callback function we can access an error object if the operation fails or when success, the actual text from the `hello.txt` file.

What's great about this is even though the `console.log` to the `hello.txt` file comes first in our script, it's not the thing that gets executed first. Node executes the callback, runs the rest of the script and then finally runs the callback when the file has been read.

The last way we can read a file in Node is by using a "promise-based" solution. Promises are also asynchronous and "non-blocking". They also tend to produce much cleaner code when compared to callbacks.

This time we're going to import `readFile` from the `promises` name space. This gives us a function that returns a promise when called:
```js
const { readFile } = require('fs').promises;

async function hello() {
  const file = await readFile('./hello.txt', 'utf8');
  console.log(file);
}
hello(); // -> Oh, hello file system
```

The `async` and `await` syntax will make our code much easier to read especially when we have multiple `async` calls in the same function.

In the next section we'll talk a bit more in depth about the `require()` function we've been using in our examples.

### Modules and npm

A module is nothing more than a JavaScript file that exports its code. Node has a ton of built in modules like `fs` and `events` that we've already been playing around with.

The traditional way to import a module in Node is to use the `require()` function. Node has added support for "es modules" which use the `import`/`export` syntax. Though, most Node.js code written in Vanilla JavaScript still uses `require()` and this is important to know as a Node.js developer.

Let's look at how we can use modules in our own code base. We'll start by creating a `module.js` file to serve as our module. Next, inside  our `index.js` file we need to create a variable for the module and import it using `require()`.
```js
// index.js file

const myModule = require('./module.js');

console.log(myModule); // -> {}
```

You'll notice when we `console.log` our module, it's just an empty object. In order to make a module useful we need to export some code from it.

Back inside our `module.js` file, we can reference this object with `module.exports`. We can add new properties to this object or redefine it as a new object. In any case, whatever we add here can be used in the other file:
```js
// module.js file

module.exports = {
  superhero: 'Thor'
}
```

Now when we `console.log` it, the object is no longer empty:
```js
// index.js file

const myModule = require('./module.js');

console.log(myModule); // -> { superhero: 'Thor' }
```

#### Using external code with npm

At some point it's very likely we will want to use somebody else's code out there in the world and the primary place to do that is via the "node package manager" or "npm".

"npm" is a tool we can use to install remote packages to use in our own code. The first step is to open the terminal and run `npm init` and we'll use the `-y` flag to use the default options:
```bash
npm init -y
```

You'll notice this created a `package.json` file in our app directory. This file contains meta data about our project. But most importantly it keeps track of the dependencies that our app is using.

The first thing we're going to install is [Express](https://expressjs.com/). Express is a minimal web application framework and one of the most popular third-party node modules.

Inside our `package.json` file you'll notice we now have a `"dependencies"` section. In addition you might notice we now have a "node_modules" directory in our app directory. The "node_modules" folder contains the raw source code for the dependency and we should NEVER have to modify code in the "node_modules" directory.

Now that we have the Express package installed, we can import it by name in our JavaScript code by simply "requiring" `express`:
```js
const express = require('express');
```

We're now ready for part 2 where we build a real full-stack application and deploy it to the cloud.
