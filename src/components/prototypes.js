/** 
Object Oriented Concepts:
 * Factory Functions
 * Constructor Functions
 * "Class" Keyword
 * "new" Keyword
 * Super Inheritance

All of this has to do with one central idea of organizing our code, designing and structuring our applications by breaking everything up into distinct patterns of objects (we can think, recipes for objects).

/**
====================================
Object Prototypes:
Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

Having a single object that contains common properties and methods that other objects of arrays or strings look to to find their common properties.

JavaScript is often described as a prototype-based language â€” to provide inheritance, objects can have a prototype object, which acts as a template object that it inherits methods and properties from.
*/

/**
Example: The Array Prototype

An array has tons of different methods.
  - Array.prototype.filter()
  - Array.prototype.pop()
  - Array.prototype.push()
  - etc.

These array methods are not defined on every single array that we make, it is only defined on the "prototype object" (Array in the above example).

So rather than having a separate method on every single array called ".push()", there is only one "prototype" and each array has a reference to that prototype with "__proto__".
*/

/**
__proto__ vs. prototype:
  * __proto__ = a reference to the prototype object.
  * prototype (String.prototype, Array.prototype) = the actual object where we add the methods or the properties to (the template object).
