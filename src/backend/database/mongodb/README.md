__MongoDB__ is a type of Document Oriented Database that stores the data in the form of JSON/BSON documents. __MongoDB__ is cross-platform and is classified as a No-SQL database program.

It’s very popular among the JavaScript Community with the advent of many stacks such as MEAN, MERN, GERMAN, MEVN where the M equals __MongoDB__.

## 1. DOD vs No-SQL

A No-SQL (originally referring to (“non-SQL” or “non-relational”) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

The data structure used by No-SQL databases includes:
1. Key-value
2. Wide-column
3. Graph
4. Document

Which makes it different from relational databases and faster than it too.

#### What is Document Oriented Database (DOD)?

A document-oriented database is a subset of No-SQL and also a subclass of the Key-Value Store data structure we mentioned above.

The main idea behind DOD is the concept of a Document. It is designed for _storing_, _retrieving_, and _managing_ document-oriented or semi-structured data.

While we have different types of DOD with different implementations, in general, they all encode data in some standard formats such as:
1. XML
1. JSON
1. YAML
1. BSON
1. PDF
1. MSWORD
1. EXCEL
1. etc
